#+TITLE: echo-bar.el
Display a custom status at the end of the echo area

* Customization
The format of the echo bar can be set using the =echo-bar-format= variable. This variable uses the same format as =mode-line-format=.

Alternatively, you can set =echo-bar-function= to a custom function to be run every time the echo bar updates, and the output of this function will be used as the contents of the echo bar.
